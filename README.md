Introduction:
•	By storing medical records on a blockchain, it is possible to have a person’s health record covering every incident and update from childhood to old age. It could involve patient’s clinical history, Lab reports, Prescriptions, Vaccination history etc.
•	The patient can be provided with a private key.
•	A patient’s private key would be required to access the relevant information from the blockchain. This public/private encryption scheme allows the patients to share unique information with different healthcare providers on as-needed-basis.
